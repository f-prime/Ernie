Ernie is a poorly written langauge interpreter for a poorly put together language in Python. Really, it was just a weekend project of mine that I found to be fun to create in order to learn a little bit about interpreter design.

As of right now, Ernie is a fully functional programming language. Should you ever actually use it for real work? I wouldn't.


Why the name Ernie?
===================

The name of the language isn't named after anyone. While I was trying to find a name for this project I happend to glace over at a guitar pick that was sitting on my desk. It said "Ernie" on it so I figured that would be the name that I would use.
